		<h1>Welcome to E-Learning</h1>
		<p>E-learning is becoming increasingly prominent in tertiary education, with universities increasing provision and more students signing up. But is it actually changing the way universities teach and students learn, or is it simply a case of students typing up their essays on computers and professors sending them course reading lists or work assignments by e-mail?

            As the world is moving towards the digital age and more and more universities are trying to maximize the use of technology in education, one must consider both the advantages and disadvantages of doing so. Although the use of technology in the field of education has revolutionized the way we learn there are still some downsides of relying completely on technology to learn. E-learning systems are the storehouses of information, training and knowledge but at the same time, they could be the storehouses of misinformation, poorly guided training or bad knowledge.
